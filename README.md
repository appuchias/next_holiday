## How it works

This can be used to find out the next holiday in a given country.
The country codes are based on the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) standard.

It uses the [nager.date](https://date.nager.at/) to get the data.
I may switch to python package [holidays](https://pypi.org/project/holidays/) in the future.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the desired folder: `cd <path>`
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/appuchias/next_holiday.git`
1. Navigate into the repo folder: `cd next_holiday`
1. Run the file: `python main.py`
